<p >Background:
	Aadhaar provides a single source of online/offline identity verification for
	residents across the country. Residents can use their Aadhaar number to verify
	and validate their identity credentials either electronically or through offline
	verification. Residents use their Aadhaar number to avail a large number of
	government services, banking services, telecom services etc.
	2. UIDAI provides technologically advanced ecosystem to ensure safe, smooth
	and speedy authentication experience to the Aadhaar number holder. The various
	provisions of the Aadhaar Act and its Regulations mandate that the entities taking
	Aadhaar number from the residents use and store it in a secure and legally
	permissible manner.
	3. On the part of resident, while giving their Aadhaar number, few dos and
	don’ts may be observed. Some of these are outlined as below:
	Dos
	i. Aadhaar is your digital identity. Use it confidently as per your choice to prove
	your identity.
	ii. While sharing your Aadhaar with any trusted entity, exercise same level of
	caution which you may do at the time of sharing your mobile number, bank
	account number or any other identity document like passport, Voter Id, PAN,
	Ration Card etc.
	iii. Entities seeking your Aadhaar are obligated to obtain your consent which
	should specify the purpose for which it is being taken. Please do insist on it.
	iv. Wherever you don’t want to share your Aadhaar number, UIDAI provides facility
	for generating Virtual Identifier (VID). You can easily generate VID and use it for
	authentication in place of your Aadhaar number. This VID can be changed after
	the end of calendar day.
	v. You can see your Aadhaar authentication history for last six months on UIDAI
	website or m-Aadhaar app. Do check the same periodically.
	vi. UIDAI intimates about every authentication over email. Therefore, linking your
	updated email Id with your Aadhaar number will ensure that you get intimation
	every time your Aadhaar number is authenticated.
	vii. A number of services can be availed with OTP-based Aadhaar authentication.
	So, always keep your mobile number updated with Aadhaar.
	viii. UIDAI provides facility for Aadhaar locking as well as biometric locking. If you
	are not likely to use Aadhaar for a period of time, you may lock your Aadhaar or
	biometrics for such time. The same can be unlocked conveniently and instantly,
	as and when required.
	ix. In case you suspect any unauthorized use of your Aadhaar or have any other
	Aadhaar related query, do contact UIDAI on toll-free helpline 1947 which is
	available 24*7 and/ or email at help@uidai.gov.in.
	x. Please do visit our social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Koo) for
	latest updates.
